		<h2>Creation</h2>

		<p>The fifth game I've made was for a three-day game jam and was published on April 17th, 2022. You can play Entombed <span><a href="https://alecduval.itch.io/entombed"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</span></p>
		<p>Entombed is a roguelike in a desert themed tomb. You must go through three levels of enemies, treasure, and civilians.</p>
