		<h2>Creation</h2>

		<p>This is what I would consider the best game I've worked on so far. It was made was for a three-day game jam hosted by B3agz (the same host as <a href="the_hive_game">The Hive</a>) and was published on April 17th, 2022.
			The theme for this game jam was "A Terrible Hero".
			In total, there were 3 people who worked on this game, and 1 playtester.
			<ul>
				<li>
					Alec (me): The lead programmer.
				</li>
				<li>
					Erik: The secondary programmer and main musician.
				</li>
				<li>
					Jaden: The main artist.
				</li>
				<li>
					Adam: The playtester (and speedrunner).
				</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Game Description</h2>

		<p>
			Entombed is a roguelike in a desert themed tomb. 
			You must go through three levels of enemies, treasure, and civilians.
			You are armed with a gun to fend off three different enemies.
			There's a Red Snake, a Bomb Mummy, and a Cursed Vase.
			The Red Snake fires slow moving projectiles, the Bomb Mummy runs at the player and explodes, and the Cursed Vase spawns Bomb Mummies.
			You can collect gold on the ground, from killing enemies, opening chests, and killing civilians.
			You can become stronger by putting gems in totems.
			These totems can make you deal more damage, move faster, have more health, and gain more gold.
			Gems can be obtained by killing civilians.
