		<h2>Creation</h2>
		<p>This is the second game I've made outside of school, and it was for a week-long game jam that was hosted by SkyanSam (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SkyriftStudios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">youtube channel</a>) and was published on April 22nd, 2021.
			The theme for this game jam was "10 seconds".
			In total, there were only 2 people who worked on this game.
			<ul>
				<li>
					Alec (me): The lead programmer and 3D modeler.
				</li>
				<li>
					Erik: The secondary programmer and musician.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h2>Game Description</h2>

		<p>
			Deletion is a bullet-hell-themed platformer about a piece of code trying to escape a computer.
			You play in third person with the ability to slow down time, regenerate health, and gain a speed boost.
			However, you only get 10 seconds of total time to do any of these actions per level.
			Each level can have different objectives; Survive, Traverse, or Both.
			In survival levels, enemies will spawn with the intent to kill you, and you must survive for a set period of time.
			In traverse levels, you must go from the spawn position to the end goal.
			In the final level, you must traverse various platforms while dodging enemies.
