		<h1>Death, Paperwork, and Minigames</h1>
		<p>The fourth game I've made was for a two-day game jam and was published on July 3rd, 2021. You can play Death, Paperwork, and Minigames <span><a href="https://alphadown.itch.io/death-paper-work-and-minigames"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</span></p>
		<p>Death, Paperwork, and Minigames is a game where you play as the Grimm Reaper, filling out the paperwork of dead people. You can increase their net worth by playing minigames.</p>
