		<h2>Creation</h2>
		<p>This is the first game I've made outside of school, and it was for a three-day game jam hosted by B3agz (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/b3agz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">youtube channel</a>) and was published on February 28th, 2021.
			The theme for this game jam was "Swarms."
			In total, there were three people who worked on this game, and three playtesters.
			<ul>
				<li>
					Alec (me): The lead programmer
				</li>
				<li>
					Erik: The secondary programmer and main musician.
				</li>
				<li>
					Jaden: The tertiary programmer and main artist.
				</li>
				<li>
					Joseph: A playtester.
				</li>
				<li>
					Adam: A playtester.
