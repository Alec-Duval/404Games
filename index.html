		<h1>Welcome All!</h1>
		<p>We are 404, and we make games for fun. 
			We've made many games for various game jams throughout the years. 
			There are 3 main people who work on games, and many others who voluntarily playtest our games.
			<ul>
				<li>
					Alec (me): Usually the lead programmer.
				</li>
				<li>
					Erik: Usually the secondary programmer and main muscician.
				</li>
				<li>
					Jaden: Usually the artist and game designer.
				</li>
				<li>
					Joseph, Jake, Adam: Playtesters
				</li>
			</ul>
			Because these games were made in a very short amount of time, they will not be bugless, perfect, nor completely accessible.
		</p>
