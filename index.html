		<h1>Welcome All!</h1>
		<p>My name is Alec Duval, and I am a game programmer and designer. 
			I started programming around Summer of 2018 (just before high school). 
			Since then, I have made many "games". 
			This site is for keeping track of all my (mostly) finished games. 
			For the record, every game here was made during a game jam, so the games may not be bug-free nor completely polished.
