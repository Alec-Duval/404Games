		<h1>Welcome!</h1>
		<p>My name is Alec Duval, and I am a game programmer and designer. I started programming around Summer of 2018 (just before high school). Since then, I have made many games. This site is for keeping track of all my (mostly) finished games. For the record, every game here was made during a Game Jam, so the games may not be bug-free nor completely polished.</p>
